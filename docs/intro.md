# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**, a comprehensive guide to building intelligent robots that can perceive, reason, and act in the real world.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through embodied agents—robots, drones, autonomous vehicles, and other mechanical systems. Unlike purely digital AI that processes text or images, Physical AI must:

- **Perceive** the environment through sensors (cameras, LiDAR, touch sensors)
- **Reason** about physical constraints, object properties, and spatial relationships
- **Act** through actuators (motors, grippers, wheels) with real-world consequences

## The Rise of Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots represent the pinnacle of Physical AI. By mimicking human form and movement, they can:

1. **Navigate human environments** designed for people (stairs, doors, tools)
2. **Use human tools and interfaces** without modification
3. **Communicate naturally** through gestures and body language
4. **Collaborate safely** in shared workspaces

### Key Industry Players

The humanoid robotics space has exploded with activity:

- **Tesla Optimus** - General-purpose humanoid for manufacturing and home tasks
- **Boston Dynamics Atlas** - Advanced locomotion and manipulation
- **Figure AI** - Commercial humanoid for logistics and manufacturing
- **Agility Robotics Digit** - Designed for warehouse operations

## Why This Book?

This textbook bridges the gap between theoretical AI and practical robotics. You'll learn:

| Chapter | Focus Area |
|---------|------------|
| 1. Introduction | Physical AI fundamentals |

| 3. ROS 2 | Robot Operating System |
| 4. Digital Twins | Simulation with Gazebo and Isaac |
| 5. VLA Systems | Vision-Language-Action models |
| 6. Capstone | Building your own system |

## Prerequisites

To get the most from this book, you should have:

- **Programming experience** in Python and/or C++
- **Basic linear algebra** (matrices, transformations)
- **Familiarity with Linux** command line
- **Curiosity** about robots!

## Learning Approach

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:

1. **Concept introduction** with real-world examples
2. **Technical deep-dive** into algorithms and architectures
3. **Hands-on exercises** with code and simulation
4. **Review questions** to test understanding

Let's begin your journey into Physical AI!
